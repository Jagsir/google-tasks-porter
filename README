This project requires a module in the root directory named "settings" which
defines the values of CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET on the module level as
strings representing the OAuth credentials of the program requesting access.
The CLIENT_ID variable should not include the suffix of
".apps.googleusercontent.com".

If you have any questions about the code please contact
google-tasks-porter@googlegroups.com.

Remember: this project requires Google App Engine to run.  If you want to
host your own copy on App Engine you will need to modify the application ID in
app.yaml and then use your App Engine SDK to upload it.
